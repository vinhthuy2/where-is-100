# where-is-100
Vietnamese paper game.
Ther Numbers from 1 to 100 are distributed randomly among the grid/paper.
Players will try to scramble those sequencial numbers as fast as possible by circle them on the paper.
When the 100 found, the game ends. Who achieved more numbers will be the winner.

For this initial version. We play with 2 player and the size is 100. Further version will be evolved to multi players and extremely large size of number. 3D approach...
